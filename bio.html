Hello! 👋 <br><br>  

I'm a Data Analyst based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Originally from Nepal, a beautiful country known for its mountains and warm people. I graduated with a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering in 2017 and moved to Canada in 2019 in pursuit of further studies and new opportunities. 🎓✈️ <br><br>
  
Outside of work, I enjoy programming, working on hobby projects, and sharing them in hopes of helping someone out. My interests revolve around data science and machine learning. 📊🤖
My first-ever project was analyzing stock market data to try predicting prices and get rich—LOL. 📈💸  <br><br>  

I love traveling, camping, hiking, and reading books. My favorite so far is The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson. I’m also a horror movie junkie 👻. Two of my favorite movies are <u>The Wailing (Korean)</u> and <u>Tumbbad (Indian)</u>. I'm happily married to my wife Shreya ❤️, and we don’t have kids yet.   <br> <br>
